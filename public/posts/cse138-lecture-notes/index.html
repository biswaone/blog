CSE138 (Distributed Systems) L3: partial orders, total orders, Lamport clocks, vector clocks


Happens Before:
  
  	
  	Figure: Happens Before relationship
  

if A and B are 2 events in the same process and A happens before B then A -&gt; B
if A is a send and B is a corresponding receive then A -&gt; B
if A -&gt; B and C -&gt; B then A -&gt; B (transitive)

How are A and E related: A -&gt; B and B -&gt; E so A -&gt; E
How are D and A related: Not related

What all places we can go from A ?

we can go to B,E,F,G but not D
we say that A and D are concurrent







Partial Order/Partially Ordered Set:

A set S, together with a binary relation often written as $a \leq b$ (a is related to b this can be the happens before relationship) that lets us compare things in set S and has the following properties

Reflexivity: $ x \in A, \ a \leq a $
Anti-symmetry: for all $a, b \in A$ if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$  then $a = b$
Transitivity: $a,b,c \in S$ if $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$


We have 8 events ${A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H}$
We are checking that whether happens before is actually a partial order

Transitivity is satisfied
Anti symmetry is vacuously true
Reflexivity is untrue as $a \leq a$ a happens before a is untrue or doesn&rsquo;t make sense


The above shows that happens before is not a partial order or can be said irreflexive partial order
Example of partial order

set containment
the subsets of set of ${a,b,c}$ is a partial order
${∅,{a},{b},{c},{a,b},{a,c},{b,c},{a,b,c}}$

${a} \leq {a}$  An element is a subset of itself
${a,b} \leq  {a,b}$ and ${a,b} \geq  {a,b}$
${a} \subseteq {a,b}$ and ${a,b} \subseteq {a,b,c}$ then ${a} \subseteq {a,c}$




Elements that are not comparable, for those happens before relation says they are concurrent, those are the elements not ordered by partial order
In total order every pair of event is ordered



Clocks

Physical Clocks

Time of day clocks
monotonic clocks


Logical Clocks: Ordering of events

Lamport clocks

Assigning number to events
Denoted as LC(A): Lamport clock of event A
clock condition: if $a \to b$  then $LC(A) \leq LC(B)$
Lamport clocks are consistent with causality


Lamport clock algorithm

Every process has to keep a counter initialized to 0
On every event on a process that counter has to increment by 1
When you send a message, a process needs to include its current counter in the message
When receiving a message, a process sets its counter to the max(local-counter, received-counter) &#43; 1



if $a \to b$  then $LC(A) \leq LC(B)$ but the reverse is not true

Lamport clocks are consistent with (potential) causality

A -&gt; B then logical clock of A &lt; Logical clock of B
characterizes causality

if LC(A) &lt; LC(B) then A -&gt; B Lamport clocks do not have this property




What something we can do with Lamport clocks ?

what can we do with P -&gt; Q
we can take its contrapositive
if P implies Q then

not Q implies not P or $\neg Q \Rightarrow \neg P$
$A \rightarrow B \ \Rightarrow \quad LC(A) &lt; LC(B)$
$\neg \ (LC(A) &lt; LC(B)) \Rightarrow \neg \ (A \to B)$
We can rule out the possibility that A happens before B
It might be the case that $ B \rightarrow A \ or \ A \parallel B $


Lamport clocks can help in ruling out things





Vector Clocks

$A \rightarrow B \ \Rightarrow  LC(A) &lt; LC(B)$  (Lamport clocks)
LC are &ldquo;consistent with causality&rdquo;
The other direction (&ldquo;characterizes causality&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t hold
Clocks that is consistent with causality and characterizes causality
$A \rightarrow B \ \Leftrightarrow LC(A) &lt; LC(B)$

Every process keeps a vector (length N for N processes) of integers initialized to 0 $[0,0,0]$
On every event, a process increments its own vector clock(all events: sends, receive and internal events)
when sending a message, a process includes its current vector clock (after the increment from step 2, because sends are events)
when receiving a message, a process will update its vector clock to the maximum(local,received). local is its own vector clock after incrementing its position, because receives are events


Max of vectors

$[1,12,4]$ and $[7,0,2]$ will be $[7,12,4]$  (pointwise maximum)


Suppose we have a vector clock of $[5,0,0]$ for alice, bob and carol this means alice has seen 5 events whereas bob and carol haven&rsquo;t seen any







CSE138 (Distributed Systems) L4: vector clocks, FIFO/causal/totally-ordered delivery


All the elements in the red circle constitute the causal history of A
Their vector clocks are smaller than A (the value of elements are smaller in every position)
The events in the blue circle are the events that are concurrent or causally independent with A



Protocols

A set of rules that processes use to communicate with each other

correctness property of execution

FIFO Delivery: if a process sends message m2 after m1, any process delivering both delivers m1 first and then m2

sending a message is something you do
Receiving a message is something that happens to you
Delivering a message is something you can do with a message you receive (you queue up a received messages and wait to deliver them)
Violation of FIFO delivery

What can we do to implement FIFO delivery

Sequence numbers: Tag your messages with sender id and sender sequence number
senders increment there sequence number after sending the message
if a received message sequence number is the SN of the prev message from that sender &#43; 1, deliver that message


What will happen if a message doesn&rsquo;t gets delivered


using sequence numbers only works well if you have reliable delivery
TCP has reliable delivery

suppose we don&rsquo;t have reliable delivery



Vacuously satisfies FIFO delivery
After every message receive bob can send ack, this also guarantees FIFO delivery but is also slow and ack could also get lost










Causal Delivery

if m1 send happened before m2 send then m1&rsquo;s delivery must happen before m2&rsquo;s delivery

How to enforce causal delivery? (Hint: Using vector clocks)
Correctness property of execution

FIFO delivery
causal delivery
Totally ordered delivery





Totally Ordered Delivery

if a process delivers m1 and then m2, then all processes delivering both m1 and m2 deliver m1 first and then m2
