Standard building blocks of data intensive applications
databases
caches
search indexes
stream processing
batch processing
The above sounds painfully obvious ?
because data systems are successful abstractions
API abstracts away the data system
Focus on 3 concerns in software systems

Reliability

The systems should continue to work correctly even in face of adversity
Tolerate user mistakes
Performance good enough under expected load and volume
Prevents unauthorized access and abuse
&ldquo;Continuing to work correctly even when things go wrong&rdquo;

Fault tolerant/ Resilient
Things that can go wrong are called fault
System that can anticipate fault and deal with it are called fault tolerant
Difference between fault and failure

Fault a single component deviating from spec
Failure when the system as a whole fails providing the desired service


Multiple faults lead to failure of the service
Chaos Monkey (Netflix)

Intentionally Inducing faults to check fault tolerance machinery in action




Types of Faults

Hardware Faults
Software Faults

Allowing processes to crash and restart
Careful thinking about assumptions and interactions
Measuring, monitoring and analyzing


Human Errors

How to make systems reliable in spite of unreliable humans

Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors
Quick rollback of configuration changes
Roll out code slowly
clear monitoring and performance metrics








Scalability

If a system grows in a particular way what are are ways of dealing with the growth?
How can we add computing resources to handle the additional growth

Load Parameters (Best choice depends on the architecture)

Request Per Seconds
Ratio of reads to write to database
No. of simultaneously active users in a chatroom
The hit rate on a cache


Describing load -&gt; Describing Performance

Increase load parameter and keep system resources unchanged how is the performance of the system affected?
When you increase load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources to keep the performance unchanged ?


Batch Processing System

We care about throughput, the number of jobs we can process per second or the total time it takes to run a job


Online Systems

We care about response time

Response time: This is what client sees
Latency: the duration that a request is waiting to be handled during which it is latent, awaiting service




Response Percentiles

Median: If median response time is 200 ms then half your requests return in less than 200 ms, and half your requests take longer than that

Metric to understand how long typically users have to wait
95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles

if the 95th percentile response time is 1.5 seconds, that means 95 out of 100 requests take less than 1.5 seconds, and 5 out of 100 requests take 1.5 seconds or more




Tail Latencies

Directly affect user experience

Amazon response time requirements for internal services in terms of the 99.9th percentile even though it only affects 1 in 1,000 requests
customers with the slowest requests are often those who have the most data on their accounts because they have made many purchase that is, they’re the most valuable customers
Optimizing the 99.99th percentile (the slowest 1 in 10,000 requests) was deemed too expensive and to not yield enough benefit for Amazon’s purposes




Head of Line Blocking

Only takes a small number of slow requests to hold up the processing of subsequent requests Even if those subsequent requests are fast to process on the server, the client will see a slow overall response time due to the time waiting for the prior request to complete, thats why necessary to measure response on client side


Tail Latency Amplification

If end user requires multiple backend calls to serve a request a single slow call can make the entire end user request slow






Approaches For Dealing With Load

Easy: distributing stateless services across multiple machines
Hard: taking stateful data systems from a single node to a distributed setup
In an early-stage startup or an unproven product it’s usually more important to be able to iterate quickly on product features than it is to scale to some hypothetical future load
Architecture is built around certain assumptions (load parameters) and if they are wrong the scaling efforts are wasted.




Maintainability

Operability

Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
Good operations can often work around the limitations of bad (or incomplete) software, but good software cannot run reliably with bad operations
Simplicity (Managing complexity)

Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system
when the system is harder for developers to understand and reason about

hidden assumptions
unintended consequences
unexpected interactions


Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can also mean removing accidental complexity

Accidental Complexity

complexity not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen by the users) but arises only from the implementation.


Removing Complexity

Good abstraction

hide a great deal of implementation detail behind a clean,simple-to-understand façade
finding good abstractions is very hard
In distributed systems many good algorithms but much less clear how to package them into algorithms that help in managing the Complexity of the system


reusable components








Evolvability

Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future
agility on a data system level: evolvability
